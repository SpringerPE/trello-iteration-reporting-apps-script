## About
A Google Apps Script for creating a report spreadsheet based on your Trello board. Read our [blog post](http://springerpe.github.io/tech/2014/09/22/trello-iteration-reporting.html), if you are interested in some background information.

## Quickstart 

1. Clone this repository

2. On Google Drive, create a new project

3. Use the [GAS-pump gem](https://github.com/SpringerPE/gas-pump) to upload the files to the new project that you have just created

4. Set up the script properties on File > Project properties > Script properties for:
 - *iterationName* -- this can be any name you want
 - *trelloAuthToken*
 - *trelloAppKey*
 - *trelloBoardId*
 - for the last three, [Pimp Your Trello Cards](http://bit.ly/pimpTrello) is a handy spreadsheet for getting the keys.

5. Optional: Change the reportName on Main.gs

6. Press the start button on Main.gs

7. Optional: Configure an automatic (time based) trigger by using the 'Resources - Current Scriptâ€™s triggers' dialog.

Voila! The report should be on your Google Drive
